# word-count-scala

Implement word-count using the map-reduce pattern.

1. Implement `mapper` and `reducer` in `WordCountUtil`
2. Run the tests: `sbt test` or run with IntelliJ
3. Display the distinct words and the number of their occurrences in `WordCount`

* Extra Credit:
** Implement `NumberCount`, be aware of non-numbers!
